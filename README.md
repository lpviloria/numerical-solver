# Numerical Solver v1.0

The Numerical Solver is an application I created for my final requirement in CMSC 150 - Numerical and Symbolic Computation. The application has the following features:

• A user-friendly UI

• 2 generic solvers which allows the user to perform:
 - Polynomial regression
 - Quadratic spline interpolation

• Calculation of the optimal diet from a given set of food items - maximizing nutrients whilst minimizing total cost
